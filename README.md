# Simple Linear Regression with CRISP-DM

This project is a simple web application that demonstrates a linear regression model. The application is built with Streamlit and follows the CRISP-DM methodology.

## Features

*   **Interactive Parameters:** Adjust the slope (`a`), noise level, and the number of data points to see how they affect the model.
*   **CRISP-DM Steps:** The application is structured to follow the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology.
*   **Visualization:** The application displays a scatter plot of the generated data and the fitted linear regression line.
*   **Evaluation:** The model's slope and intercept are displayed and can be compared to the original parameters.

## How to Run

1.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## File Structure

*   `app.py`: The main Python file containing the Streamlit application.
*   `idea.md`: The initial idea and requirements for the project.
*   `hw1.py`: (Not used in the final application)
*   `log.md`: A log of the development process.
*   `README.md`: This file.
